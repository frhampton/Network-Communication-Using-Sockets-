# Socket-Sever-project
I approached this project by getting the methods to work first. I enjoyed learning how to manipulate files using java. Each case was straight forward once you found out what you had to do. The thing I had trouble with was communicating the client with the server. When I first started I was sending to much output from the client to the server and I was getting errors in my information. After a few days of working on this I looked at the SocketThrdServer and SocketClient for help which is what I based my code around. A problem I ran in to is when I made the delate method the first time I deleted my whole project folder lucky I had a backup but it showed me that you have to specify where to delete a file at and itâ€™s not a good idea just do delete a whole folder if you want to get rid of files . This is the first time I used anything with java.net.The things are learned are:
Communication with Client/server with bufferreader and printwriter
How do display files in a folder with java code
How to delate files with java code
How to make files with java code
How to copy files to other folder in java code
 After making the Client/server program I want to try my hand at making a text client for fun.  The end result is that it works and it dose everything on the project requirements.
